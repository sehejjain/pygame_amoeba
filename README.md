# An Amoeba Inspired approach for searching in Unknown Environments using Swarm Robots
Sehej Jain, Rohit Thakur and Prof. Vijay Kumar Gupta
## Introduction
The aim of the project is to find an efficient way of searching in Unknown Environments. This implies that the robots have no prior knowledge of topography. Situations like post-disaster rescue missions are an example where such algorithms would be extremely efficient.

This project (UG-18) was selected to receive a grant from the AI and Robotics Park to conduct a research project on the above mentioned problem.
